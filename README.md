in order to understand the Computational Functions of the polynomial and the monom, we recommend reading more information from the following links:

junit to the class:
1. Monom
2. polynom
# Getting Started:
see the java docs to understands the function, If you wish to examine the correctness of the various functions in the class, you should go to the Test class and the junit test: Polynomtest and Monomtest. also you have option to see gui of the Polynom by the class FunctionGraph that built on the library of gral, see in the link- http://trac.erichseifert.de/gral/ .
